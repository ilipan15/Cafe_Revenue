### Project outline 

A café receives 50 croissants daily. During the morning hours, the croissants can be sold individually for £1.00. The croissants can also be used to make sandwiches for lunch time. Regardless of the other ingredients in a sandwich, each croissant brings £1.50 if used for a sandwich. Suppose that the demand in the morning for individual croissants is Poisson with mean 50 and the demand for croissant sandwiches during lunch is Poisson with mean 20.

* Suppose that the café does not reserve any croissants for lunch time and serves customers based on a first-come first-served (FCFS) basis. Compute the café’s expected daily revenue.

* How many croissants should the café reserve to be used for lunch time sandwiches in order to maximise their expected daily revenue?

* What is the expected daily revenue from this protection (reserve) policy? What is the per cent improvement compared to the expected daily revenue from the FCFS allocation that was computed in the first part.

* Explore how the allocation decision changes with changes in the expected demand for sandwiches, the revenues that each croissant brings as an individual breakfast item or as a sandwich, and the number of croissants the café receives daily. For example, is it better to protect more croissants for lunch time if the demand for lunch time is higher?
